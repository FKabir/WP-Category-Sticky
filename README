Allows you to set posts sticky for individual category archives.

Note that this plugin uses the "the_posts" filter. This means you can set a post sticky for a category that it doesn't belong to, and it will show on that category when the archive is viewed.

Sidebar widgets will also reflect the sticky order when an archive is being viewed.

Improvements welcome.
